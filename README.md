# Fullstack-Open
Fullstack Open is a free full stack development course by the University of Helsinki. This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native and Continuous integration.

Other topics include debugging applications, configuration, managing runtime environments and NoSQL databases.

I have decide to follow this course closely to develop my skills in web development. All progress are documented in this github repository.
